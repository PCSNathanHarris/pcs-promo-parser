# SOP: Installing the PCS Promo Parser Plugin in Claude Code
**Version:** 1.0 | **Plugin Version:** 1.0.0
**Applies To:** All PCS team members using the Kit Builder workflow
**Maintained By:** Nathan Harris (nathan.harris@pcstools.com)

---

## Overview

This SOP walks you through installing **Claude Code** (the terminal version of Claude) and the **PCS Promo Parser plugin** on your Windows machine. Once set up, the plugin will update automatically every time you open Claude — you will never need to run these setup steps again.

**Estimated time:** 10–15 minutes for a first-time install.

---

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- Internet connection
- A Claude.ai account (**Pro or Max plan required** — free accounts cannot use Claude Code)
  - If you do not have one, go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) and sign up, then upgrade your plan before continuing.

---

## Part 1 — Install Node.js

Claude Code runs on Node.js. You only need to do this once per machine.

**1.1** Open **PowerShell** as a normal user (no need to run as Administrator).
- Press `Win + S`, type `PowerShell`, click **Windows PowerShell**.

**1.2** Check if Node.js is already installed:
```powershell
node --version
```
- If you see a version number like `v20.x.x` or higher, **skip to Part 2**.
- If you see an error like `'node' is not recognized`, continue with step 1.3.

**1.3** Install Node.js using Windows Package Manager:
```powershell
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
```
- Accept any prompts that appear. The install takes 1–3 minutes.

**1.4** Close PowerShell completely, then reopen it. Verify Node.js installed correctly:
```powershell
node --version
npm --version
```
Both commands should return version numbers. If either still errors, restart your computer and try again.

---

## Part 2 — Install Claude Code

**2.1** In PowerShell, run:
```powershell
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```
This installs the Claude Code CLI globally on your machine. It takes about 1 minute.

**2.2** Verify the install:
```powershell
claude --version
```
You should see a version number printed. If you see `'claude' is not recognized`, close and reopen PowerShell, then try again.

---

## Part 3 — First-Time Login

**3.1** Start Claude Code:
```powershell
claude
```

**3.2** The first time you run this, Claude Code will ask you to log in. It will open a browser window automatically.
- Log in with your **Claude.ai account** (the same email/password you use on claude.ai).
- After logging in, return to PowerShell. You will see the Claude Code prompt.

> **Note:** If the browser does not open automatically, copy the URL printed in PowerShell and paste it into your browser manually.

**3.3** You are now inside a Claude Code session. The prompt looks like:
```
>
```
You can type messages to Claude here, or use slash commands (which start with `/`).

---

## Part 4 — Install the PCS Promo Parser Plugin

Run these commands one at a time inside your Claude Code session (at the `>` prompt).

**4.1** Add the PCS plugin marketplace:
```
/plugin marketplace add PCSNathanHarris/pcs-promo-parser
```
Wait for the confirmation message before continuing.

**4.2** Install the Promo Parser plugin:
```
/plugin install pcs-promo-parser
```
Wait for the confirmation message.

**4.3** Verify the plugin installed:
```
/plugin
```
This opens the plugin menu. You should see **pcs-promo-parser v1.0.0** listed under the **Installed** tab.

Press `Esc` to close the menu.

---

## Part 5 — Enable Auto-Updates

This step ensures you always have the latest version without doing anything manually.

**5.1** Open the plugin menu:
```
/plugin
```

**5.2** Use the arrow keys or `Tab` to navigate to the **Marketplaces** tab.

**5.3** Highlight **pcs-tools** and press `Enter` to open it.

**5.4** Find the **Auto-update** toggle and press `Enter` or `Space` to turn it **ON**.

**5.5** Press `Esc` to close the menu.

That's it. From now on, every time you start `claude`, it will automatically check for and install any new version of the plugin in the background.

---

## Part 6 — Using the Plugin

**6.1** Start a Claude Code session in PowerShell:
```powershell
claude
```

**6.2** Run the promo deck parser by typing:
```
/parse-promo-deck
```
Claude will guide you through providing the PDF and any other required inputs.

**6.3** Output files will be placed in the working directory where you started `claude`, named in the format:
```
<Vendor>-<Q#>-<YYYY>-<Type>.csv
```
For example: `DeWalt-Q2-2026-Promo-List.csv`

---

## Part 7 — Starting Claude Code in the Future

After the one-time setup above, starting a session is just:

**7.1** Open PowerShell.

**7.2** Navigate to the folder where you want your output files saved:
```powershell
cd "C:\path\to\your\output\folder"
```

**7.3** Start Claude:
```powershell
claude
```

Auto-update runs silently on startup — you do not need to do anything else to stay current.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| `'claude' is not recognized` after install | Close and reopen PowerShell. If it persists, restart your computer. |
| Browser login page doesn't open | Copy the URL from PowerShell and paste it into Chrome manually. |
| Plugin menu shows an old version after an update was released | Type `/plugin marketplace update pcs-tools` to force a refresh. |
| `npm install` fails with a permissions error | Do NOT run PowerShell as Administrator. Run it as a normal user. |
| Claude asks for an API key | You need a Claude Pro or Max subscription at claude.ai — free accounts do not work with Claude Code. |
| Plugin not found after `/plugin marketplace add` | Confirm the repo is public at github.com/PCSNathanHarris/pcs-promo-parser, then retry. |
